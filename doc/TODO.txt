Easy :
- Consider additionals OSX architectures
  (VALID_ARCHS = m68k i386 sparc hppa ppc ppc7400 ppc970 ppc64 x86_64 armv6 armv7)
  easy thanks to xcode.
- make the arguments for the buld.sh/bat call not platform-specific and stop hoping that no one other that
  Android will need them.
  Just have to define a argN property and fill it depending on the platform, or to set them once for all.
- Make the VS Integration works everywhere with non-relative paths. Right now, it should fail at some points
  (like in the output path), particularly in remote builds.
  
Medium :
- VS Integration for deployment on Android
- Execution on Android

Hard :
- Test on iOS
- Copy files for remote build, removing the need of a mounted shared folder
- debug cpp in Android
- debug cpp in iOS

Unknown :
- Other windows platforms (Phone ...)
- Add cross-platform support for Linux CMake (not sure if it is well done)
  cross-platform FOR Linux sounded like a pain in the ass (contrarely to FROM Linux ...)
- do the call to cmake in the vcxproj tmp folder instead of always __tmp_build
  build scripts and VS targets have to be modified, adding an argument
- Clean everything (repository, targets, cmake files, ...)
